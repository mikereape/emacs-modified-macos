Emacs Modified for macOS
========================

This is GNU Emacs modified to include the following add-on packages:

- ESS 18.10.2;
- AUCTeX 12.1;
- org 9.2.4;
- Tabbar 2.2, an emacs minor mode that displays a tab bar at the top,
  similar to the idea of web browserâ€™s tabs;
- markdown-mode.el 2.3;
- exec-path-from-shell.el 1.12 to import the user's
  environment (by default PATH, MANPATH, LANG, TEXINPUTS and
  BIBINPUTS) at Emacs startup; 
- psvn.el r1573006 to work with Subversion repositories from
  within Emacs;
- framepop.el, to obtain temporary buffers in separate frames;
- default.el and site-start.el files to make everything work together.

The distribution is based on the latest stable release of GNU Emacs
compiled by David Caldwell (http://emacsformacosx.com).

Tabbar is not enabled by default. To use it, use 'M-x tabbar-mode' or
add '(tabbar-mode)' in your ~/.emacs file.

In order to use Markdown you may need to install a parser such as
Pandoc (see https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest) and
customize 'markdown-command'.

You may want to customize 'exec-path-from-shell-variables'.
